I am research assistant in Electrical Communication Engineering at Indian Institute of Science where I am fortunate to be guided by Professor Chandra Murthy. I obtained my B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Signal Processing, Machine learning, Optimization and Networks, more specifically focusing on algorithm design for problems in the above mentioned fields.
