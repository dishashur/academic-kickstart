Early 2017 welcomed the onset of 5G communication technology based on 3GPP Release 15 standards that guarantees more speed, density and reliability in terms of data transfer. An initiative towards this direction has been undertaken by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), Govt. of India to develop an indigenous 5G testbed at IISc. As a part of this project, I was instrumental in establishing the 5G PHY layer. The project involved development of the same across multiple platforms such as Keysight and X310 and B210 USRPs. I led the interoperability of the software stack of PHY layer with Keysight signal analyzers. Further, I drove the establishment of Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) on X310s. Work is still going on in this regard.

The participation of our team at National Conference on Communication(NCC) 2019 and Indian Mobile Congress (IMC) 2019 was lauded by the academicians and technologists alike. The official videos can be accessed on the link provided.
